  The arrival of the FXi-WP signals a new era for A&amp;D Mercury where we can now offer a precision top loading balance with laboratory level performance suitable for use in hostile environments.
  An IP-65 rating ensures the FXi-WP will be at home in areas previously thought to be out of bounds for a precision top pan.

  Using a system of sealing gaskets and membranes the unit can be used “out of the box” without the need for additional enclosures which have traditonally added considerable expense to the location of balances in this type of environment.
  Containing all of the operating features that have become so popular in the standard FX-i , the WP version provides a best weighing increment of 1mg and high speed settling time brought about by the revolutionary  A&amp;D SHS (Super Hybrid Sensor).
