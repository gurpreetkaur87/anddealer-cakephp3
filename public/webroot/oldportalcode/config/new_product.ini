  The SV-A is the latest addition to the family of revolutionary Sine Wave Vibro Viscometers. The SV-10 and SV-100 have introduced a ground breaking new discipline to the viscometry market with their ease of operation, high accuracy and fast testing times.
The SV-A has been added to the range to address applications where the sample is so precious that the absolute minimum must be used for a viscosity measurement. 
The vibro method can now be used to assess the viscosity of samples as small as 2ml (SV-1A) while still retaining the 1% repeatability that has become synonomous with the other SV models.

  <p>
  Featuring measurement ranges of 1000mPa/sec (cP) and 10,000 mPa/sec (cP) the SV-1A and SV-10A are perfect devices for use in R&amp;D applications where maximum traceability is required as is highlighted with the tri-directional measurement platform.
  The SV-A has a host of optional accessories which allow the viscometer to be customised for particular application.
  </p>
  <p>
  As is standard with SV Series units the software program WinCT Viscosity is supplied as standard while the SV-A includes a new feature of a standard Serial/USB allowing direct connection to PC via the USB port.
