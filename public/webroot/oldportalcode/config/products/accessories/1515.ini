2="<p>The AD-1690 will rule if a device passes or fails an air pressurisation test immediately indicating if the item requires attention or repair.</p>
<p>As the AD-1690 works on an evacuation principle instead of an injection method it prevents foreign particles being "pulled" into the device potentially causing damage.</p>
<p>
The device comes with three attachments for pipette testing allowing pipette volumes of 1&micro;l to 10,000 &micro;l to be tested.
Data can be output to a peripheral device via the RS-232C interface.</p>"
