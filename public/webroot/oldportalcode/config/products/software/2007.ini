The A&amp;D Weighing software package Multi-Weigher is designed to run on a Microsoft
Windows operating system. The Multi-Weigher software package was written using
Borland Delphi, the software was designed to meet the growing needs and requirements
for weight data capture in industry today.
</p>
<p>
The Multi-Weigher software is capable of monitoring, checking and grading the weight
data of various products that are passed over the connected scales.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class='bold'>Operating Systems</span><br/>
The Multi-Weigher software can run on any Microsoft Operating Systems like:
Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT, XP Professional and XP Home Edition.
  </li>
  <li><span class='bold'>Visually Appealing</span><br/>
The software utilises soft Pascal colors in bold text for the identity of the target, under,
over and erroneous weights. OK weights in olive, Under in orange, Over in red and
Errors are inverse solid red blocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class='bold'>Various Products</span><br/>
The Multi-Weigher software can be used to collect weight data from: Platform Scales,
Scientific Balances, Weight Indicators, Checkweighers, Counting Scales and other
weighing devices.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class='bold'>Various Protocols</span><br/>
The data string input to the computer from the weight scale can be modified to suit
any piece of weighing equipment, from any scale manufacturer as long as the scale is
fitted with a serial interface. The serial interface can be any one of the following:
    <ol>
      <li>RS232 Serial Output and Serial I/O.</li>
      <li>RS485 Serial Output and Serial I/O.</li>
      <li>RS422 Serial Output and Serial I/O.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class='bold'>Data Bases</span><br/>
The Multi-Weigher software package stores its data in a comma delimited text format
which can be easily read by products like MS Excel. The data recorded is: Weight, Time,
Date, Product, Operator, Station and Errors. These records can either be printed or
viewed on the monitor screen.

    <span class='bold'>Reports</span><br/>
Reports can be viewed, printed and sorted by Date, Month, Operator, Product, Table,
Station, Transaction, Transaction summary or Custom Extra data fields.

<span class='bold'>Checkweigher</span><br/>
The Multi-Weigher software can be optioned up-graded to included data capture from
either the Dolphin AD4404 or Dolphin AD4820 Checkweighers.
RsCom transmits the weighing data to your computer using a text file format, and allows "Transmit Commands" to control the balance. Transmit Commands include: Calibrate, On/Off, Print, Query (for "transmit") weight data, Re-zero, Range, Sample, Mode & Zero. When used with the balance functions, you can output/print the GLP data to a PC printer directly, without any software application.
