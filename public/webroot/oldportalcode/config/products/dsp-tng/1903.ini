2="<h3>Display:</h3>
<p>With the integrated development environment tool (MC Ladder), you can customize or build a screen display of your own design to track the status of your task.  Merely by selecting the tools in MC Ladder, you can design the optimal display panel for easy to read operability, incorporating panel switches and meters, lamps or trend graphs.</p>
<p>
Equipped with an STN color liquid crystal touch panel.  Offering excellent visibility and operability with its 5.7 inch (320 x 240 dots) size, with a brightness life of around 75,000 hours (half life) it also provides sound durability.  And, because it is waterproof (IP-65) it can also be washed clean by water.

<p>Connects to any kind of network or transmission device via its transmission interface (LAN, RS-232C/422/485, USB, RUN output), equipped as standard.  Up to 4 interface boards can be installed on the I/O board application part.  Up to 4 channels of analog I/O interface board (or 8, depending on type) modules can be loaded, enabling a compact design suitable for a large scale system.  Its line up of many DI/DO boards and relay boards for control and transmission, in combination with the I/O module means it can be used in a wide range of measurement and control applications.</p>"
