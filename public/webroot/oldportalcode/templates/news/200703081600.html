  We have just updated the website with a new category in the scales section and a new form for requesting a service or repair on your weighing equipment.
  </p>
  <p>A New "<a href="web.php?p=1391&g=1-6&pp=1385">Value Weighing Products</a>" category has been added to the Scales section of the website. To launch this category we're featuring the all new <a href="web.php?p=1327&pp=1391">SJ-HS Bench Scale</a> as the categories top product. We have also been listening to your feedback and have moved the SK & SK-WP Series "Balances" into this new "Value Weighing Products" to make them easier to find.</p>
  <p>Our service manager has been working hard to make it easier to arrange a service or repair on your weighing equipment. To help him acheive that goal we have added a "<a href="web.php?p=1021">Service & Repair</a>" item to the left hand menu. Simply fill in your details and a description of the work required and our Service Staff will take care of the rest.</p>
