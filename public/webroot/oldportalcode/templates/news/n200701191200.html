  In 2006 A&D Mercury celebrated 60 years of serving the Australian Weighing industry. To mark this event we have put together a short history about the company we hope you'll find interesting. We've even included an image of some of the original buildings that occupied the Adelaide factory site in 1912. <a href="{url}web.php?p=1002">See the "About" page for details.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  It's now time to look at the future and see what the next 60 years will bring, and more importantly, what we can bring to you.
