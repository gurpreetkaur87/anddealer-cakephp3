  <p>
  A&amp;D Mercury is proud to announce the release of the exciting new FX-i Precision Top Pan Balance range.
  </p>
  <p>
The FX-i joins the extremely successful GX and GF series to form the most extensive top pan balance range in Australia.
</p>
<p>
While jam packed with features, the FX-i is around 40% lighter and up to 47% smaller than most of it’s competitiors.
</p>
<p>
Traditional A&amp;D functions such as Piece counting , Visual Comparator, Percentage Mode and Animal Weighing are all present in this impressive package.
On top of the traditional A&amp;D functionality there are new innovative features such as a Statistical Calculation Function, optional USB interface and an optional Ethernet interface.
</p>
<p>
An environmental setting ensures that the FX-i will always provide optimum performance regardless of the location in which it is used, while a standard RS232C Data interface means your FX-i can output data to a peripheral device such as a printer or P.C., directly out of the box.
</p>
<p>
A cobalt blue Vacuum Fluorescent Display ensures that the FX-i can be read from any viewing angle, while an Auto Power Off feature will ensure maximum life of the optional rechargeable battery.
</p>
<p>
A simple calibration routine, using external masses, makes for easy maintenance.
</p>
<p>
A range of 15 different measurement units ensures the FX-i will provide the answer to your particular weighing requirement, while the underhook facility makes the balance ideal for density measurement or for weighing materials with magnetic properties.
</p>
<p>
With the features outlined, it’s clear that the FX-i provides unparalleled value for money.
