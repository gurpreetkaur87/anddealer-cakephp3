            <p>Sorry, We seem to have lost the file you are looking for.</p>
            <p>There are many possible reasons for this, but we'd ask you to check the following first:
              <ul>
                <li>Is the URL spelt correctly?</li>
                <li>Try reloading the page, very ocassionally we just miss the file the first time</li>
                <li>Try going to our <a href="web.php">Main</a> page and looking for the file from there</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are sure that the file your looking for does exist and that we really have lost it, please contact the <a href="web.php?p=1004&s=web">webmaster.</a>
            </p>
